 #screen runs command in separate screen
 #-L tells screen to write everything to a log file
 
 # SPAdes is a program written in python, we'll call it directly from the installation directory
 # '--careful' tells SPAdes to do extra error correction. From the manual: "Tries to reduce the number of mismatches and short indels. Also runs MismatchCorrector â€“ a post processing tool, which uses BWA tool (comes with SPAdes)."
 # '--memory 8' tells SPAdes to use only 8Gb of memory. If you have less in your virtual machine, set this lower. If you have more, set it higher.
 # '--pe1-1' and '--pe1-2' tell SPAdes that these two files belong to the same paired end library (#1); the first set of reads is often named '*R1_001.fastq' and the second set is often '*R2_001.fastq' but you'll have to find these from your fastq downloads
 # '-o ./spades-run1' tells SPAdes to save the output to a folder in the current directory called 'spades-run1'

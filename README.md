### Working in the cloud
- using Github for version control
- using PATRIC for genome and metagenome analysis
    - Exercise 3: <https://github.com/Ecological-and-Evolutionary-Genomics/eeg2018/wiki/Exercise-3---Feb-12---PATRIC>
- using IMG and MG-RAST for comparative genomics and metagenomics
- using Galaxy for comparative genomics and metagenomics
    - Exercise 10: <https://github.com/Ecological-and-Evolutionary-Genomics/eeg2018/wiki/April-2----Exercise-9----Galaxy-Workflows>

### This is the course website for Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics 2018

#### The course is taught by Eric Collins (@rec3141), Assistant Professor of Biological Oceanography at the University of Alaska Fairbanks

#### We are using GitHub as a repository for code developed in class and for background material related to the class.

### Bash shell and command line environment
- using BioLinux  
 - <https://github.com/Ecological-and-Evolutionary-Genomics/eeg2016/wiki/Jan-19-Intro-to-BioLinux>
- bash scripting  
 - <https://github.com/Ecological-and-Evolutionary-Genomics/eeg2016/wiki/Jan-23---Exercise-1>
  - <https://github.com/Ecological-and-Evolutionary-Genomics/eeg2016/wiki/Jan-25-Exercise-2>  

### Working in the cloud
- using Github for version control
- using PATRIC for genome and metagenome analysis
- using IMG and MG-RAST for comparative genomics and metagenomics
- using Galaxy for comparative genomics and metagenomics 
- using the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center for taxonomic identification of short reads

### Similarity searching
- using BLAST and DIAMOND

### Taxonomic identification  
- from amplicon sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes, with mothur
- from metagenomes, with k-mers using Kaiju
- from metagenomes, with conserved core genes using Phylosift

### Genome Assembly and Annotation
- genome assembly with SPAdes
- genome annotation with RAST

### Metagenome Assembly and Binning
- metagenome assembly with metaSPADES
- metagenome binning with metaBAT
- metagenome bin visualizaiton with VizBin, anvi'o?
